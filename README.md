# 12-years-IPL
Udacity project 
This year IPL completed 13 years, in-spite of Covid-19 and lack of fans in the stands  this year's IPL was as good as any other. 8 teams fight it out in round robin games to reach top 4 and secure a place in play-offs. These top 4 teams play 2 qualifiers and 1 final to decide the 2 finalists who fight it out to claim the throne. 
 
Objectives
Questions related to the data set that will be answered here : 
1. Which is the best performing team in IPL history, based on total number of titles and matches won?
2. How toss affects the outcome of the game?
3. Which overs are best to score runs and which ones give yield most number of wickets for bowlers.

Here, I am trying to analyze data from first 12 seasons of IPL and provide insights from the dataset. There are two data sets, 1. Deliveries Data (ball by ball) and 2. Matches Data (summary data for each game).

This is a descriptive analysis. you can find the details about this work in the blog : https://shashik19.medium.com/indian-premier-league-12-years-analysis-30549416fec6
