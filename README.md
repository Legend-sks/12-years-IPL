# 12-years-IPL
Udacity project
This project is part of Udacity Nano degree program for Data scientists. This is first project in 4, this project requires to write a Blog Post on a choosen topic and perform data analysis on a data set to answer 3-5 business/data questions. I have choosen IPL dataset to complete this project.

This year IPL completed 13 years, in-spite of Covid-19 and lack of fans in the stands  this year's IPL was as good as any other. 8 teams fight it out in round robin games to reach top 4 and secure a place in play-offs. These top 4 teams play 2 qualifiers and 1 final to decide the 2 finalists who fight it out to claim the throne. 

Files in this repository: 
1. Readme file 
2. IPL_12-years.ipynb : Jupitor Notebook containing all the analysis and code
3. deliveries.csv : csv file containing ball by ball data for 12 years of IPL games
4. matches.csv : CSV file containing each match result, teams, winner, umpire, venue etc..
 
Objectives:
Questions related to the data set that will be answered here : 
1. Which is the best performing team in IPL history, based on total number of titles and matches won?
2. How toss affects the outcome of the game?
3. Which overs are best to score runs and which ones give yield most number of wickets for bowlers.

Conclusions:

1. Mumbai Indians and Chennai super kings are most consistent team in IPL. MI winning 4 titles and CSK having a win percentage of 60% and 3 titles.
2. Toss has some effect on the outcome of the game. Teams like CSK have a win percentage of 65% when they win toss and this puts them at advantage, specifically during final and semi-final stages.
3. Best overs to score runs and take wickets are last 5 overs of the game. Here Batting team takes more risk and this attributes to both more runs and more wickets. First 6 overs of powerplay also produce more runs compared to middle overs. 6th over of the inning provides some opportunity for bowlers to take wickets as batsman tries to maximize gain from the last over of powerplay and takes more risk.
